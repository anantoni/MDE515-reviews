\begin{abstract}

Whenever phenomena with apparent irregularity are observed over large
samples of data, it is important to detect the statistical properties
of the system which cause such regularities. This paper presents
Zipf's Law, a law proposed by G.K. Zipf to model the regularity behind
some naturally occurring phenomena. This is, in essence, an
algebraically decaying function describing the probability
distribution.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Zipf's Law is a law first formulated by G. K. Zipf using mathematical
statistics. This paper presents on various formulations of Zipf's law and
describes a few attempts at statistically explaining its theoretical
underpinnings. Zipf's Law models an empirical phenomenon which has been
observed in data studied in several physical and social sciences and the
author attempts to consolidate various cases in which Zipf's law has been
empirically shown to hold and concludes with the investigation of real data
distributions, as an independent verification of the law.

\section{Formulation of Zipf's Law}
\subsection{Simple form}

The simple form of Zipf's suggests that rxr = constant where r is the
rank of xr is the size of the rth data value in an ordered set. This
rank-size relation is known as Zipf's Law and its graph is a
rectangular hyperbola.

\subsection{Generalized form}

A main drawback of the Zipf's Law is that the phenomena observed by
Zipf and justified by statistical rationale lead to a family of
distributions described by the zeta function.

\section{Theoretical foundation of Zipf's Law}
\subsection{Cumulative Advantage Distribution}

Price presented the cumulative advantage distribution, which can be
derived as a stochastic birth process.

\subsection{Mandelbrot's derivation}

By assuming that the aim of language is to transmit the most
information per symbol with the least effort Mandelbrot obtained the
following relationship:

\begin{equation}
  \label{simple_equation} f(r) = K(r+c)^{-\theta}
\end{equation}

where $f(r)$ is the word frequency and $r$ is the rank of the word. The
constant $c$ improves the fit for small $r$ and the exponent improves the
fit for large $r$.

\subsection{Simon's approach}

Simon expanded on Zipf's work by describing a set of empirically
derived skew distribution functions.

\subsection{Rationale behind Zipf's law}

The empowerment of Zipf's law assumes some properties about the system
being studied. In the case of a system limited to the usage frequency
of words in literature, Simon observed that the stochastic process by
which words are chosen to be included in written text follows two
steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \item By process of association, i.e., sampling earlier segments of
his/her word sequences.
  \item By imitation, i.e., sampling from other works by self or other
authors.
\end{itemize}

The assumptions made in Simon's formula are:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item The probability that the (T + 1)st word has appeared exactly
r times is proportional to the total number of occurrences of all
words that have appeared r times.
   \item For large T, there is a constant probability ω that the (T +
1)st word has not appeared in the first T words. item
\end{enumerate}

The process of association produces words which can only be the
results of the first assumption, while the process of imitation can
also produce words which are the results of assumption 2.

\section{Verification of Zipf's law on real distributions}

The author attempted to verify Zipf's law using real life data, in
particular using a database of statistics of some NBA players for the
years 1991-92. Many of the statistics demonstrated roughly hyperbolic
graphs, which lead to the claim that Zipf's law was empirically
verified for this particular real life database.

\section{Paper Evaluation}
\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
\item Some categories of phenomena display some apparent regularities
but are not easy to explain using simple laws of nature. However, it
is essential to be able to model such categories of phenomena even if
it not (yet) possible to fully model establish a mathematical which
reasons them. Having some information about a set of data can make a
lot of difference compared to having no information at all. This is
why Zipf's law has so many applications in spite of its empirical
nature which is a limiting factor to its application.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
\item As already mentioned the empirical nature of Zipf's law is
itself limiting. A series of unbiased experiments is required in order
to ascertain that the behaviour described by Zipf's law is
present. Moreover, while in some cases it is possible to explain the
behaviour observed (for instance in the case of Big cities vs Small
cities) in other cases it is possible that the behaviour observed is
accidental or the subset of a behaviour described by a more
generalized mathematical model.
\item The verification method used in Section 5: ``Verification of
Zipf's law on real distributions'' is an anti-paradigm of how
scientific evaluation experiments should be demonstrated in scientific
work. The selective presentation of a plot and the statement that the
expected behaviour was observed in other statistics is by no means a
scientifically approved method of verification\footnote{While I am
aware of the nature of this paper which was an introductory article
regarding Zipf's law, its generality and its derivations and the
properties of systems obeying Zipf's law rather than a full work
intended for peer review, for the purpose of this homework I consider
my my argument valid. In fact this paper reminded of an article by
Jeffrey D. Ullman on his website:
\href{http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/pub/experiments.pdf}{Experiments
as Research Validation – Have We Gone too Far?}}.
